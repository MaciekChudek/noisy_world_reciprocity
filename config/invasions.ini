T_exp = 6  						; Interaction sequences per-pair (starts as both good, goes for geometrically distributed rounds) 

[Simulation Type]
Confusion = 0		; if 1 or true, then strategies get independent uncorrelated signals
MapGradients = 0	; if 1 or true, then we map selection gradients (using uniform distros) instead of invasion analysis

[Repetitions, exponents base 10]     
T_exp = 0  						; Interaction sequences per-pair (starts as both good, goes for geometrically distributed rounds) 
G_exp = 0  						; Generations to evolved for
N_exp = 6  						; Pairs to sample in each generation

[Simulation Type]
Confusion = 1		; if 1 or true, then strategies get independent uncorrelated signals
MapGradients = 1	; if 1 or true, then we map selection gradients (using uniform distros) instead of invasion analysis
